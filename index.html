          <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Brittany Soares. I am a recent graduate from Curry College with a Bachelor of Science in Software Development. I have experience programming in Java, C#, Python, VBA, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have also been a tutor in a majority of these languages since sophomore year. To execute these languages I have used multiple programming environments including Eclipse and Visual Studio. In addition to my programming experience I also am knowledgeable in APIs and have created my own through Postman.
<br>
<br>
Aside from the programming aspect of applications, I have experienced the design process for each of these applications. Throughout the design process I have conducted interviews with a range of clients where I have collected various requirements and features. I then take these requirements and features to create specific user stories. As I build each application, I continuously showcase my work to the client to ensure we are on the same page. This is something I come to know as very important.
<br>
<br>
I am confident that I will be able to execute these skills and more if given the opportunity to work for you.
